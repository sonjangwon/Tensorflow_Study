Yes, I am a teacher at Columbine high school. There is a student here with a gun. He just shot out a window. I believe one um   I don't know if it's. I don't know what's in my shoulder. If it was just some glass he threw or what   I am. Yes, yes! And the school is in panic and I'm in the library. I've got students down under the tables. Kids! Heads under the tables.  Um, Kids are screaming. The teachers, um, are, you know, trying to take control of things. We need police here.  Can you please hurry? I do not know who the student is. ... I was on hall duty, I saw a gun. I said, What's going on out there? And the kid that was following me said it was a film production, probably a joke
And I said, well I don't think that's a good idea. And went walking outside to see what was going on.  He turned the gun straight at us and shot and, my god, the window went out. And the kid standing with me, I think he got hit Kids! Head down. I'am sorry?
