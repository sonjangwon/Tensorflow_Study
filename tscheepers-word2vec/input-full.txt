political traditionalist critique pseudoconservative president
celebrated american historian richard hofstadter offered explanation mccarthyism essay contributed american scholar titled pseudoconservative revolt looking back essay year later hofstadter noted written nothing else comparable brevity aroused attention drew request quotation reprinting
seeking understand underlying social psychology mccarthyism hofstadter borrowed term pseudoconservative philosopher theodor adorno designate american cloaked serious restless dissatisfaction american life tradition institution guise rhetoric conservatism hofstadter studied alternative explanation political conduct hypothesized dissatisfaction pseudoconservatives based fear loss status common open society social mobility relatively fluid
compounding fear mccarthy era anxiety generated postworld war ii nuclear arm race created doomsday scenario mind many american alienated group began describing conservative term appeared identify diametrically opposed force riley perceived threatening life mad social position hofstadter pointed however strictly political perspective nothing authentically conservative argument first place trying desperately overturn status quo new deal america conserve furthermore adhered ideology antiintellectualism substituting feeling emotion rational discourse millennium characterized history western conservative thought pseudoconservative tends ordinarily incoherent political issue hofstadter wrote result maintained politics emphasized unarticulated psychological impulse reasonable analysis politics gut word rather mind
another reason hofstadter considered mccarthyism form pseudoconservatism rage expressed opposition american political system political philosophy analogous conservatism personality trait stress moderation practicality prudence look leap bird hand worth two bush might well credo hofstadter reminded reader american scholar however mccarthyism virtually nothing common temperate compromising spirit true conservatism classical sense word
today another form pseudoconservatism threatens american institution administration george w bush public policy six year shaped discount reason practice politics largely inchoate sentiment
order recognize counterfeit quality pseudoconservatism hofstadter identified well compassionate conservatism bush sometimes espouses one turn political philosophy aristotle edmund burke work notably aristotle politics nicomachean ethic burke reflection revolution france found heart aristotle burke thinking belief existence natural law set moral ideal give meaning term honor integrity justice courage neither aristotle burke possessed much faith rationality morality human being feared without guidance natural law provides human would forfeit opportunity lead virtuous life establish government aristotle burke considered universal moral idea meant apply every human relationship including economics
aristotle burke supported private property free enterprise basis distinguishing characteristic human being possession soul make possible u exercise free become unique individual one advantage private property taught help u develop manifest individuality well express one cherished ideal generosity people would largely empty virtue aristotle burke support private property free enterprise unlimited standard natural law require owner treat worker way would like treated role reversed challenge merchant provide consumer fair product fair price
perspective make bush administration example pseudoconservatism dogmatic commitment laissezfaire policy deny relevance universal ideal rely primarily market force guide economic activity pursuit laissezfaire economic policy bush administration relaxed banking standard introduced nobid government contract allowed private corporation greater access public land refrained limiting monopolistic practice sought furthermore reduce governmental responsibility welfare elderly citizen advocating privatization social security account
assuming form economic justice result relatively unchecked selfishness individual corporation policy human behavior reinhold niebuhr child light child darkness echoed aristotle burke rejection unlimited economic freedom smug optimism people think harmless egotist niebuhr remarked could fail understand economic process left severely alone either strong devour weak case monopoly displaces competition competition breed chaos community
consistent inconsistency bush administration celebrates economic freedom acting curtail basic american freedom privacy religion speech press government hesitates apply explicit moral standard economic behavior qualm restricting fourth amendment right warrantless search loosening rule confidentiality medical record supporting faithbased initiative cause citizen subsidize religion belong ordering librarian divulge information material checked patron attempting influence content national approach sexual issue among manifestation pseudoconservatism hofstadter observed vindictive quality policy espoused opposing abortion well convenient access birth control administration demonstrated punitive attitude toward sexual conduct
another serious disconnect bush administration traditional western political conservatism foreign policy although aristotle burke believed universal ideal idealist instead practiced politics prudence seek adjust immutable natural law constantly changing situation circumstance unique value prudence aristotle wrote ability ensure government right thing right time fight way burke called prudence first virtue alone teach government bring power right harmony indeed burke famous criticism french revolution based upon appreciation political prudence
although burke promoted ideal free government prudence taught society organism require great care order endure flourish modified consequently considerable thought patience end th century france living feudal autocrat century revolutionary ignored past tried introduce historically unprecedented level liberty fraternity equality society virtually overnight burke predicted death destruction beyond anything french ever experienced would soon transpire
burke favored american revolution hand judged american former english men woman seeking adapt traditional english ideal selfrule new home considered coal relatively moderate one would serve lay firm foundation evolution free government united state burke explained reflection
flatter love manly moral regulated liberty well gentleman blame anything relates human action human concern simple view object stand stripped every relation nakedness solitude metaphysical abstraction circumstance gentleman pas nothing give reality every political principle distinguishing colour discriminating effect circumstance render every civil mid political scheme beneficial noxious mankind
aristotle burke theory evolutionary change bush administration decision invade occupy iraq clearly imprudent number explanation offered justify policy one saddam hussein possessed nuclear weapon another league al qaeda terrorist attacked united state latest need remake iraq democracy serve political role model rest middle east although first two explanation discredited thorough investigation several bipartisan congressional committee strategy call mind hofstadter observation pseudoconservatives suspicious reasonable analysis often rely kneejerk reaction reach policy decision
bush former secretary treasury paul oneill revealed ron suskind book price loyalty president reason never explained fully seemed like snap judgment time informed cabinet thinking seriously overthrowing saddam especially shocking oneill bush announced conviction iraq day inauguration full eight month conviction something need order act oneill said action need proportional depth evidence underlies conviction
third explanation even bewildering traditional conservative point view iraq never come close democracy iraqi people never free rarely shown inclination fight therefore administration vision democratic iraq reminiscent mistake made french revolutionary acted dream easily translated political reality upheld ideal freedom neither able adapt ideal specific circumstance encountered unable appreciate staggering cost human life property unavoidable radical change pursued short period time
bush administration attitude toward national debt environment represent another break western conservative tradition aristotle burke writing remind today generation moral responsibility leave world better place descendant walter lippmann explained essay public philosophy young men die battle country sake old men plant tree never sit six year supplyside economic policy increase government spending decline administration left child national debt trillion refusing ratify international kyoto protocol global warming deciding requiring automobile manufacturer raise fuelefficiency rating withdrawing fund epa fema corp engineer discouraging wetlandspreservation project administration may set stage future environmental catastrophe order hurricane katrina child cope disaster
similarity bush administration policy hofstadter description pseudoconservatism include hostility toward united nation penchant amending constitution insistence political conformity inability make subtle distinction international player required effectiveness world political stage reliance populist rhetoric antiintellectualism john bolton bush un ambassador taken position institution largely irrelevant bush administration supported amendment constitution regarding flag burning homosexual marriage american want set traitorous cutandrunners failure senator mccarthy follower recognize communist regime soviet union china yugoslavia vietnam different seems similar bush administration insistence organization al qaeda hezbollah hamas part unified group islamofascist terrorist furthermore bush administration approach issue creationism placing replica ten commandment public place terri schiavo debacle contains good deal antiintellectual populist rhetoric
perhaps valuable aspect hofstadter american scholar essay ability explain year later traditional conservative tend get exasperated bush administration traditional conservative one consider loyal citizen want believe president know keep trying little success appreciate logic budget deficit incoherent foreign policy attack constitutional right hofstadter teach u policy never meant understood logically die first place wrote later essay pseudoconservatism revisited
rule pseudoconservatism express emotion formulate policy fact hard translate claim policy program concrete objective part proponent politics le concerned us power alleged misuse offer positive program solve social problem operative content demand likely negative call u mainly prohibit prevent censor censure discredit punish
despite brilliance hofstadter analysis major difference pseudoconservatism traditional counterpart neglected discus aristotle burke pessimistic view human nature belief system natural law set moral parameter human appreciates difficulty involved translating morally preferable ideal politically feasible policy commitment moderation caution major component traditional conservatism emphasis doubt limit traditional conservative believe universe imposes profound restriction individual government accomplish adhere according noel osullivan book conservatism philosophy imperfection committed idea limit regard human being imperfect dependent creature doomed make best thing modest policy compromise accommodation
bush administration however consistently recognized doubt limitation despite burgeoning national debt administration decline heed advice fiscal conservative either raise tax seriously reduce public spending despite devastation caused hurricane katrina administration persists ignoring warning prominent scientist destructive effect global warming despite former army chief staff eric shinseki concern administration went ahead preconceived plan diminished force certainty bordering arrogance administration behaved belief national debt somehow disappear nature heal global warming iraqi soon come sens welcome american savior conclude democracy preferable secular religious tyranny
certainty face strong evidence contrary hallmark ideological thinking ultimately ideological quality bush administration policy classifies pseudoconservative whereas ideologue advance one doctrinaire solution every problem regardless circumstance traditional conservative expect political leader adjust conviction situation hand whereas ideologue prefer deal political abstraction traditional conservative seek practice practical form politics operates burke word level le earlier later balance advantage inconvenience good traditional conservative limit doubt administration adherence strategy presidential leadership call doctrine unitary executive among people participated formulation doctrine bush appointee attorney general alberto gonzales justice samuel alito gonzales helped develop served bush white house counsel alito lawyer ronald reagan justice department administration doctrine unitary executive mean executive branch interpret law way want even interpretation differs markedly directive congress supreme court
although doctrine represents egregious violation separation power president used impunity bush claimed disregard law prohibiting warrantless wiretapping domestic phone call said intends ignore provision patriot act disagrees bush announced vehemently opposed military commission act considered torture enemy combatant congress caved president pressure virtually granted power interpret geneva convention see fit
twoterm presidential limit effect end bush administration sight expect pseudoconservatism run course recent midterm election result indicate moderate american grown disillusioned pseudoconservative policy time hofstadter would maintain mccarthyism followed presidential campaign barry goldwater george wallace richard nixon silent majority reagan presidency current administration inevitable another version pseudoconservatism appear american political scene
long citizen remain fearful status society long american continue dread attack powerful enemy committed destruction country hofstadter warned specter pseudoconservatism never completely vanish prophetically noted live already shown u ugliest capacity human spirit consideration suggest pseudoconservative political style one long wave contemporary american history momentary mood

physicianassisted suicide among hotly debated bioethical issue time every reasonable person prefers patient ever contemplate suicidewith without assistanceand recent improvement pain management begun reduce number patient seeking assistance however patient experience terrible suffering ca nt relieved therapeutic palliative technique medicine nursing offer patient desperately seek deliverance
physicianassisted suicide nt physician becoming killer patient whose suffering ca nt relieve turning away ask help physician feel ca nt course nt obliged physician consider merciful help patient merely writing prescription unreasonable place jeopardy criminal prosecution loss license penalty
many argument put forward maintaining outweighed two fundamental principle support ending prohibition patient autonomythe right control one body physician duty relieve suffering
society recognizes competent patient right autonomy decide wo nt done body almost universal agreement competent adult right selfdetermination including right lifesustaining treatment withheld withdrawn suicide illegal throughout united state longer illegal part country yet assisting person take life prohibited every state oregon patient seek help cruel leave fend weighing option traumatic uncertain humane assistance could made available
physician obligation many cure impossible palliation failed achieve objective always residual obligation relieve suffering ultimately patient patient judge whether death harmful good sought marcia angell former executive editor new england journal medicine put way
highest ethical imperative doctor provide care whatever way best serf patient interest accord patient wish theoretical commitment preserve life matter cost suffering greatest harm consign desperate patient unbearable suffering force patient seek stranger like dr kevorkian
let examine key argument made physicianassisted suicide first much weight placed hippocratic injunction harm asserted sanctioning physicianassisted suicide would give doctor license kill physician accede request branded murderer illogical inflammatory withdrawal lifesustaining treatment example accepted society yet requires definitive act physician prescribing medication patient requested free take see fit latter perceived harm former rather characterizing killing see bringing dying process merciful end physician complies plea final release patient facing death unbearable condition good harm action entirely consonant hippocratic tradition
second argued request assisted suicide come largely patient nt received adequate pain control clinically depressed nt properly diagnosed treated question proper management condition would significantly reduce number patient consider suicide sanctioning assistance contingent upon prior management pain depression
however treatable pain common reason patient seek end life severe body wasting intractable vomiting urinary bowel incontinence immobility total dependence recognized important pain desire hastened death growing awareness loss dignity attribute associate particularly human factor commonly reduce patient state unrelieved misery desperation
third argued permitting physicianassisted suicide would undermine sense trust patient doctor curious reasoning patient lying bed wondering physician going kill permitting assisted suicide nt create fear since act administering fatal dose would solely within control patient rather undermining patient trust would expect legalization physicianassisted suicide enhance trust spoken great many people feel would like able trust unrelieved suffering making possible would give patient greater sense security furthermore patient taken life relatively early stage terminal illness precisely feared progressively increasing disability without anyone assist would rob option later time truly desperate patient contemplating suicide would much le likely take step confident receiving assistance future desired
fourth argued patient nt need assistance commit suicide manage seems callous unrealistic patient shoot jump window starve death rig pipe car exhaust method used patient final stage desperation hideous experience patient survivor even patient ca nt contemplate traumatic act instead manage weak complete process without help therefore face high risk failure dreadful consequence family
fifth argued request assisted suicide frequent enough warrant changing law interestingly physician say rarely ever received request others say often received request curious discrepancy think explained patient seek help suicide cautiously test physician receptivity idea simply wo nt approach physician unreceptive thus two subset physician situation open idea assisted suicide nt patient likely seek help former latter
study carried year ago university washington school medicine queried physician percent sample primary care physician physician selected medical respondent percent reported receiving one explicit request assisted suicide onefourth patient requesting assistance received prescription
survey physician san francisco treating aid patient brought response half percent respondent reported helping patient take life prescribing lethal dos narcotic clearly request assisted suicide ca nt dismissed rare occurrence
sixth argued sanctioning assisted suicide would fail address need patient incompetent obviously true since proposal legalization specify assistance given patient competent request however essence argument say establish procedure deal every patient wo nt make assisted suicide available patient logic imagine outcry logic applied procedure organ transplantation benefited many people country open door physicianassisted suicide find slippery slope leading coercion involuntary euthanasia vulnerable patient learned grapple many slippery slope medicine resuscitate dnr order withdrawal life support nt deal slippery slope prohibition rather adopting reasonable ground rule setting appropriate limit
slippery slope argument discount real harm failing respond plea real people considers potential harm might done others future time place case slippery slope theoretical future harm mitigated establishing appropriate criterion would met patient could receive assistance criterion outlined frequently stated briefly include patient must incurable condition causing severe unrelenting suffering patient must understand condition prognosis must verified presented considered patient patient must clearly repeatedly request assistance dying psychiatric consultation must held establish patient suffering treatable depression prescribing physician absent close preexisting relationship would ideal must get know patient well enough understand reason request physician expected violate basic value physician unwilling assist patient facilitate transfer another physician would prepared foregoing must clearly documented
application criterion would substantially reduce risk abuse could nt guarantee abuse would never occur must recognize however abuse occur today part tolerate covert action subject safeguard open process would word philosopher ethicist margaret battin prod u develop much already make often quite casual cavalier way
seems improbable assisted suicide would pose special danger elderly infirm disabled paraphrase john maynard keynes long run elderly infirm disabled since society well know serious attention would surely given adequate protection abuse nt intention dispose glibly fear society would view vulnerable patient liability would manipulate end life prematurely course concern must respected risk minimized applying criterion listed furthermore argument assumes termination life invariably evil must protect vulnerable patient poor otherwise lacking societal support definition speaking patient desperately wish final release unrelieved suffering poor vulnerable patient least able secure aid dying want good luck find physician willing provide covert help poor disenfranchised rarely access assistance today world
eighth argued netherlands experience prof societal tolerance physicianassisted suicide lead serious abuse aside fact data subject varying interpretation depending upon analysis one belief situation netherlands hold lesson u many year country followed ambiguous practice technically prohibiting tacitly permitting assisted suicide euthanasia
climate united state different regulatory mechanism would different much stricter course expect different outcome experience oregon one fifty state permit physicianassisted suicideis instructive first three year oregon law effect seventy terminally ill patient took advantage opportunity selfadminister medication end protracted dying despite dire warning precipitous rush uninsured nt victimized almost seventy patient health insurance hospice care people least college education untoward complication oregon experience far relevant united state dutch experience vindicates despite extremely vocal opposition advocated legislation
ninth argued society nt assure citizen right basic health care protect catastrophic health cost business considering physicianassisted suicide find astonishing argument say every patient seek ultimate relief severe suffering case wo nt considered u assured basic health care financial protection certainly proper goal decent society wo nt attained united state becomes generous responsible nation day seems far patient seeking deliverance future development even visible distant horizon
finally argued status quo acceptable patient determined end life find sympathetic physician provide necessary prescription physician virtually never prosecuted act least four reason reject status quo first force patient physician undertake clandestine conspiracy violate law thus compromising integrity patient physician family second secret compact nature subject faulty implementation high risk failure consequent tragedy patient family third assumption determined patient find sympathetic physician applies best middle upperincome person ongoing relationship physician poor already noted rarely opportunity fourth covert action place physician danger criminal prosecution loss unlikely risk certainly inhibits physician believe proper help patient
believe removing prohibition physician assistance rather opening flood gate illadvised suicide likely reduce incentive suicide patient fear great suffering final stage illness would assurance help would available needed would inclined test ability withstand trial lie ahead
life precious gift sane person want part circumstance life lost value competent person thoughtfully considered situation find unrelieved suffering outweighs value continued life nt starve death find drastic violent solution merciful mean exist physician wish fulfill perceive humane responsibility patient nt forced legislative prohibition sensitive problem however believe reasonable protection put place minimize risk abuse humanitarian benefit legalizing physicianassisted suicide outweigh risk physician bound injunction harm must recognize harm may result commission wrongful act also omission act mercy every physician feel comfortable offering help tragic situation many believe right society criminalize humanitarian act

police speed witness
police must investigate vehicle accident necessary initiate prosecution driver caused crash investigation police typically interested determining speed vehicle reason speed one important cause car crash shibata fukuda analyzed data traffic accident various risk factor including driving without license consumption alcohol speed use seatbelt speed important risk factor fatality
police rely number source skid mark location extent damage vehicle determine speed vehicle involved collision however majority case important source evidence eyewitness see kebbell milne therefore important police know much reliance place eyewitness found witness reasonably good example recent study involved mockeyewitness estimate speed civilian police car witness remarkably accurate typically estimating le mile per hour kmph actual speed vehicle barnecutt pfeffer creswell froyland ainsworth pfeifer marshall semb
nevertheless real police investigation witness may fare le well extensive body research show eyewitness memory susceptible distortion reconstructive nature memory mean postevent information may incorporated memory witness confident inaccurate information ayers reder smith kassin ellsworth possibility illustrated study loftus palmer participant shown film car accident later asked fast car going smashed smashed one following word collided bumped hit contacted although word refer coming together two object differ imply speed force impact
participant received smashed version estimated speed mph kmph whereas given contacted version estimated speed mph kmph furthermore participant received smashed version likely answer yes question see broken glass even though broken glass fact leading question influence even subtle loftus zanni found even change wording question increased proportion witness misled eg see broken headlight
fortunately use leading question minimized many police officer trained interview eyewitness manner reduces use question kebbell milne wagstaff nevertheless witness account may biased suggestive postevent source information introduced police officer instance witness interviewed concerning vehicle vehicle involved sort collision fact witness know vehicle crashed may encourage witness attribute crash speed vehicle may cause witness overestimate speed vehicle prior crash
also fact vehicle involved crash may alter eyewitness belief way vehicle driven although speed major factor causing crash explanation possible driver responsible side street without seeing oncoming vehicle research hendricks et al crash involving vehicle suggested caused error
alternatively mechanical failure tire blowout brake failure appear responsible case treat et al consequently study wanted determine whether belief vehicle crashed would influence eyewitness estimate well vehicle driven implication driver driving perfectly safely may falsely remembered driving dangerously simply subsequently involved crash experiment
address idea knowledge vehicle crashed may potentially influence witness estimate speed dangerousness vehicle driven conducted experiment manipulate knowledge vehicle crashed hypothesized witness believed vehicle crashed would estimate speed vehicle higher know witness believed vehicle crashed would remember way vehicle driven dangerous method

result two experiment mixed hypothesized effect knowledge vehicle crashed cause witness overestimate vehicle speed supported experiment result suggests accident involving civilian vehicle simply know crashed however found significant effect experiment obvious difference two experiment experiment used police vehicle flashing light siren one possible explanation result may witness crashed police car condition aware police driver highly trained therefore unlikely crash normal condition given knowledge mock witness may reasoned highly trained police driver crash must traveling high speed
alternatively additionally witness likely associate police light siren highspeed pursuit may overestimate speed thus overestimate speed explicable within activationbased framework term source activation confusion anderson bower reder schunn concept high speed activated knowledge vehicle crashed use flashing light siren vehicle activation concept influence memory speed vehicle give high estimate unfortunately likely unconscious process witness unaware occurred kelley jacoby
latter point supported confidence judgment crashed police car condition whereas mock witness significantly overestimated speed police vehicle le confident condition uncrashed police vehicle condition important finding confidence often used infer accuracy fox walter leippe manion romanczyk instance witness say absolutely certain car mile per hour likely believed one say thought car mile hour sure practical implication finding confidence speed vehicle number witness provide estimate vehicle speed investigator careful simply relying confident witness
returning issue speed estimate mock witness condition experiment underestimated speed civilian vehicle whereas uncrashed condition experiment police car using light siren accurate witness crashed condition overestimated speed vehicle although accuracy focus experiment fact stimulus presented via videotape rather witnessed real life reduces ability generalize finding suggest witness speed estimate influenced factor actual speed vehicle vary greatly treated caution
experiment difference found likely crash likely driver kill someone absence significant effect experiment show crash likely kill someone believed vehicle crash later however experiment significant difference found two condition participant crashed condition rated driver likely crash likely kill someone show witness report concerning way vehicle driven influenced flashing light siren belief vehicle crashed reason report likely source activation confusion
nevertheless significant effect found crashed uncrashed condition concerning remembered dangerousness even flashing light siren belief vehicle crashed cause remembered dangerousness increase however film vehicle simply driven straight road constant speed perhaps vehicle driven ambiguous manner instance vehicle swerve avoid pedestrian witness estimate perceived dangerousness way offer potential considerable future work research use heuristic recall relevant work show heuristic particularly likely invoked little time engage systematic analysis b individual overloaded information andor c little available information macrae hewstone griffith potentially police car flashing light night likely command attention cue unavailable determine speed hence distortion found police vehicle may exacerbated nightfall

investigate relationship worry sense humor author administered worry domain questionnaire wdq f tallis eysenck matthew multidimensional sense humor scale msh j thorson f c powell undergraduate worry negatively related sense humor result stepwise regression using wdq criterion msh factor predictor showed humor production factor msh loaded negatively step coping humor factor loaded positively step result discussed relation w e kelly j miller cognitive model worry worry coping strategy
key word anxiety coping humor worry
worry sequence negative sometimes seemingly uncontrollable thought borkovec commonly experienced phenomenon indeed tallis davey capuzzo found every day despite obvious transitory nature worry much recent research approached phenomenon trait propensity worry instance commonly used measure worry worry domain questionnaire wdq tallis eysenck mathews testretest reliability indicate measure trait worry tallis davey bond
researcher investigating characteristic individual propensity worry trait worrier reported worrier compared nonworriers tend report physical discomfort obsessional symptom boredom depression stress anxiety perfectionism pessimism borkovec robinson pruzinsky dupree chang jung kelly markos macleod starcevic tallis de silva noteworthy although worry sympton generalized anxiety disorder gad american psychiatric association instance davey reported worry anxiety account separate variance coping worry often associated active cognitive coping whereas anxiety associated avoidant coping indicates worry anxiety separate construct
kelly miller proposed cognitive model worry helpful conceptualizing individual difference worry suggested trait worrier assumption world general dysfunctional specifically worrier developed three primary underlying belief everything potentially dangerous b able find perfect solution every problem andor avoid potential negative consequence c inadequate helpless protect solve problem
hence worrier attempt cognitively evaluate situation ability protect situation follows combination worrier belief able solve problem inadequacy solve problem elicits underlying belief world general determine individual information processing characteristic way thinking behaving ie personality
perhaps unpleasant trait experience associated worry ie anxiety depression pessimism feeling inadequacy characteristic many worrier kelly miller positive attribute rarely examined relation worry one would expect worry would conversely related positive trait often case instance chang reported worry negatively related life satisfaction however worry always negatively related positive behavior trait kelly ashley found worry negatively related excessive alcohol use individual le likely worry likely engage excessive alcohol consumption
appears despite negative connotation worry may serve positive function davey found worry often function positive examined relation trait worry sense humor
martin defined sense humor comprehension appreciation creation humor consistent general definition thorson powell suggested sense humor consists several element including recognition oneself humorous recognition others humor appreciation humor propensity laugh perspective allows appreciation life absurdity use humor cope humor according mcghee incorporates general attitude playfulness coinciding ability play idea cognitive ability manipulate reframe idea playfully enables individual sense humor view unpleasant event funny instead frightening annoying stressful surprising therefore individual greater sense humor endorse depression loneliness negative mood social inadequacy cetola moran massam sarmanyschuller hampes endorse task motivation cheerfulness selfesteem trust social dominance hampes kuiper mckenzie belanger overholser ruch carrell thorson powell
several researcher documented fact sense humor moderate reduces negative unpleasant affect example yovetick dale hudak found individual scoring higher sense humor report le anxiety individual scoring lower sense humor even placed anxious situation newman stone reported humor lead decreased selfreported tension decreased physiological activity associated stress labott martin indicated coping using sense humor buffer effect negative event mood state brown keegan found humor also relieved boredom hence possessing sense humor tends moderate stress anxiety allows individual
although increase humor worry literature topic continue relatively neglected researcher time writing found published investigation relationship worry sense humor therefore purpose study examine relationship basis previous literature establishing fact high worry low sense humor related negative psychological outcome individual greater sense humor better able thwart negative thinking affect hypothesized worry would significant negative relationship sense humor method

calculated separate stepwise multiple regression using five wdq domain predictor variable msh factor criterion humor production factor confidence domain wdq significant predictor accounting variance humor production score f p subsequent regression using remaining msh factor criterion found wdq domain accounted significant result study supported hypothesis worry significantly negative relationship sense humor thus seems individual sense humor le likely worry finding consistent previous research lower score sense humor related negative psychological outcome nezu nezu blissett overholser finding cann holt calhoun humor moderate negative outcome stressful event russell davey found worry appears occur often result stressful life event hence sense humor might moderate relationship stress worry researcher explore possible moderating effect
multiple regression result indicated humor production factor msh largely contributed negative relationship worry sense humor understanding personality worrier provides partial explanation result fear inadequacy model one might assume worrier would le likely participate risky situation feel unprotected inadequate
hesitation worrier participate risky situation appears also include social situation commonly reported characteristic worrier appears fear negative social evaluation pruzinsky borkovec found worrier reported significantly selffocused attention social anxiety publicly displayed aspect nonworriers thus worrier would likely avoid placing risky social situation might result negative evaluation others
production humor may appear worrier risky situation could elicit negative evaluation others relationship found confidence worry domain wdq humor production partially support possibility worry confidence hinder individual producing humor might expected worrier would question ability produce humor way others would find favorable future research necessary determine whether fear negative similar explanation might made relationship worry relationship humor individual worry disrupting losing relationship might le inclined use humor fear others approve humor
one interesting finding coping humor positively related worry result partially explained function worry instance accounting anxiety worry measured wdq described active cognitive coping mechanism davey hence worry humor serve coping mechanism le surprising worry coping humor positively related
result present study implication treatment worry previous research indicates humor helpful decreasing negative affective cognitive state cann et al moran moran massam newman stone therefore increasing production humor reduce worry unpleasant affective state depression often coexist worry starcevic furthermore evidence humor might effective reducing unpleasant psychological outcome among worrier among individual prone worry newton dowd reported using therapeutic intervention involving absurdity effective individual reporting le sense humor worrier individual greater sense humor using respectful humorous therapeutic intervention increasing production humor facilitating playful humorous perspective among client may prove helpful technique counselor working worrier
relatively low percentage shared variance worry sense humor noted instance although result predicted significant negative relationship found worry sense humorthe percentage shared variance wdq msh somewhat low however statistical significance result indicates johnston amount shared variance humor production msh confidence wdq also suggests meaningful predictable relationship exists two variable moreover high internal consistency scale see table suggest scale greatly affected error variance nunnally thus likely relationship two variable study stable relatively free error variance
present study several limitation considered future researcher instance result based college student sample therefore clinical implication noted discussion tentative study involving clinical sample conducted also present study used one instrument measure construct future research include additional measure worry sense humor
addition statistical limitation present study instance sometimes prone inflated risk capitalizing chance relationship specific sample judd mcclelland although believe use stepwise regression warranted exploratory nature analysis used study future study include different regression approach attempt replicate expand finding present study
future research include larger diverse sample attempt replicate finding present study exploration relationship humor production worry may provide useful information understanding reason worrier report le sense humor production humor instance one question future research whether lower humor production among worrier result fear negative evaluation result another yet undetermined factor social inhibition selffocused attention research also needed experimentally evaluate clinical efficacy using humor therapeutic technique worrier
